# Minimal Reproducible Example 

Example of working and non-working parts


<Katex>{`
Below is an example of a formula
$$
s = ut + 1/2 \\cdot at^{2}
$$
Or it can work inline $$b^2$$.
However! There are certain parts that do not work!
For example, fraction bars do not show up: 
$$
\\frac{1}{2}
$$
And the not equals sign does not work either 
$$
0 \\neq 1
$$
